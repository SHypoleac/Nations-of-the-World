Credits of [Nations-of-the-World mod](https://github.com/SHypoleac/Nations-of-the-World) 
for [Unciv game](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv) 

As a lover of Unciv, I was looking for a mod that would allow me to add only civilizations, buildings and units to the game, without unnecessary upgrades that upset the balance of the game.
Using a few examples, I selected the right nations and rebuilt their skills, buildings and units, as well as created unique personalities for each ruler so as to expose the strengths and weaknesses of each, while maintaining balance between them.
So many of the nations now have completely new skills that require the selection of a unique development path, and changed the way opponents behave, making the game more diverse and interesting.

Now you can start exploring the world of civilizations anew, with honest, loyal and pious rulers at the helm, as well as treacherous warriors whose only goal is military domination!

If you have any comments, or would like to help in the further development of this mod then feel free to discuss. Thanks and have a great game!
