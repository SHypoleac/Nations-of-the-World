Salutations, Eva Perón, spiritual leader of the Argentinian nation and wife to Juan Perón. Yours is the second largest country in Latin America, and its name has derived from the rumors of the existence of silver mountains; what is certainly rich is history in both pre-columbian and republican eras. With the primitive Hispanic American reality fractured in La Plata Basin due to immigration, its inhabitants have come to be somewhat deal with all the dangers but also with all the advantages of that condition: because of their European roots, they deeply linked the nation with the enduring values of the Old World; and because of their condition of colonials, they link themselves to the rest of the continent, through the folklore of the interior and the old Castilian that unifies the people, feeling somehow the vocation of the Patria Grande San Martín and Bolívar once imagined. =

Greetings, most wise and prudent Sir Henry Parkes, father of the Australian Federation. Australia truly is a unique and ancient land, more so than any other, for its lands abound in nature's gifts and its shores have beckoned, welcomed, and harbored immigrants from afar for over 50,000 years. By the time you arrived in Sydney as an English immigrant in 1839, Australia was divided into thriving British colonies of undeniably vital significance. By 1889, as premier you had led the colony of New South Wales five times to achieve many great things that undoubtedly improved the lives of many. You will always be remembered, however, in the hearts of Australians, for being instrumental in the process of federating the Australian colonies into a single united nation, earning you the humble title of "The father of the Australian Federation". Thanks to your efforts, Australia today remains one of the most wealthy, prosperous, and modern countries in the developed world, and truly a sight to behold. =

Fledgling Belgium looks to you, Leopold II, King of the Belgians.

Though your reputation abroad would ultimately succumb to controversy, your public works would nonetheless put the Belgian people on the path to progress.  =

All Hail his most respected and magnanimous Emperor, Pedro II of Brazil.

Maganimous King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, your shining legacy is everlasting. When you came to the Magyar throne, your nation was going through a tumultuous time, threatened as it was from all sides; seeing this with perfect clarity, you established a permanent professional army, and thus the fearsome mercenary Black Army was born: unusual in its size and comparison, it famously incorporated the use of muskets. But perhaps the pinnacle of your reign is the fact that you made Hungary the first country outside Italy to adopt the principles of the Renaissance: learned men from all countries, not just Italy itself, travelled to Hungary to talk about arts, and your legendary library was rivaled only by that of Venice. =

Few can boast your patriotism and commitment to the cause of a Free Ireland, Commander Collins. Though you came from the humblest of beginnings, you truly embodied the pride of Irishness. It was not long before you joined the struggle for Home Rule, and you began to build a reputation for yourself – one of dedication, devotion, and pride for Ireland. After the Easter Rising turned bloody, you managed to turn a beaten movement into a potent physical force, one that would successfully found an Irish nation, fight a war for liberation, and win independence. Some did not share your view, however, and soon this incomplete nation descended once more into war. And though you paid the ultimate cost in the subsequent civil war, you gave your life for a free state that was established soon after. =

Hail to you, brave Nzinga Mbande, Queen of the Ndongo and Matamba, whose beauty is matched only by your cunning. Your Kingdom is part of the great Kingdom of Kongo, situated at the mouth of the mighty Congo River in west-central Africa. You defied tradition by claiming two thrones and are remembered for standing bravely against the onslaught of European imperialism. When the Portuguese invaded your lands, you escaped death and shrewdly manipulated the Dutch into sending you aid. Together you turned back the army of the Portuguese at the Battle of Kombi. Yet, ever faced with threats both inside and out, the never-ending war took its tool, and in the end not even your bravery could stop the march of foreign crowns. =

Mighty Queen of Kongo, your people has been chained and sold into slavery. Yet, your old alliances stand firm and await your call.

With the throne thus claimed and popular support on your side, you defeated the army of Edward I, the English monarch whom you had previously driven from your lands, and one of the greatest threats your nation had ever faced. It was your actions which established a tenuous peace between your warring Kingdoms, fostering a common history which culminated in the union of the two kingdoms under a Scottish monarch in the year 1707. Yet your legacy is one of ensuring the protection of the culture and freedom of the Scottish people, for which you shall forever be remembered. =
