When you came to the Magyar throne, your nation was going through a tumultuous time, threatened as it was from all sides; seeing this with perfect clarity, you established a permanent professional army, and thus the fearsome mercenary Black Army was born: unusual in its size and comparison, it famously incorporated the use of muskets. But perhaps the pinnacle of your reign is the fact that you made Hungary the first country outside Italy to adopt the principles of the Renaissance: learned men from all countries, not just Italy itself, travelled to Hungary to talk about arts, and your legendary library was rivaled only by that of Venice.",

Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?",

After the Easter Rising turned bloody, you managed to turn a beaten movement into a potent physical force, one that would successfully found an Irish nation, fight a war for liberation, and win independence. Some did not share your view, however, and soon this incomplete nation descended once more into war.
