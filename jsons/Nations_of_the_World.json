		"startIntroPart1": "Maganimous King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, your shining legacy is everlasting. When you came to the Magyar throne, your nation was going through a tumultuous time, threatened as it was from all sides; seeing this with perfect clarity, you established a permanent professional army, and thus the fearsome mercenary Black Army was born: unusual in its size and comparison, it famously incorporated the use of muskets. But perhaps the pinnacle of your reign is the fact that you made Hungary the first country outside Italy to adopt the principles of the Renaissance: learned men from all countries, not just Italy itself, travelled to Hungary to talk about arts, and your legendary library was rivaled only by that of Venice.",
		"startIntroPart2": "King Matthias the Just, God has called upon you to usher a new epoch of absolute greatness by calling upon your loyal people and lead them to glory? Can you rebuild your legendary library and at the same time let the Black Army serve as both a sword against your enemies and a shield protecting your nation? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?",
