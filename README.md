## Nations of The World
is a mod for [Unciv](https://github.com/yairm210/Unciv) that includes
### 20 balanced civilizations with unique units, buildings and personalities

Meet the cultured **Pedro II**, the expansive **Gajah Mada** or insanely militaristic **Shaka Zulu** and other major rulers of the world\
and see who will prove to be your devoted ally and who will want to betray you at the first opportunity! 

**Each of them is unique** and requires a different path of development to make the most of their **brand new skills**,
so start exploring the brave new world of civilizations and learn their weaknesses to take over the world! :)
